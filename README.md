### Introduction
I have created these two projects in C language as assigned to me by Cipher Byte Tech to address practical needs in education and finance management:

### Project: Student Grade Management System

This C program manages student grades, allowing users to input student information and subject scores. It calculates average scores, identifies highest/lowest scores, and provides a summary of students' performance.

### Features:

- Input student information and multiple subject scores.
- Calculate and display average scores.
- Identify highest and lowest scores.
- Provide a summary of students' performance.

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the program using a C compiler.
3. Run the executable file.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input student information and scores.
5. View the calculated results.

## Project: Bank Account Management System

This C program simulates a bank account management system, allowing users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, check balances, and calculate interest based on different account types.

### Features:

- Create bank accounts.
- Deposit and withdraw funds.
- Check account balances.
- Calculate interest based on account types.

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the program using a C compiler.
3. Run the executable file.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various banking operations.
5. View account balances and interest calculations.
